# 🏡NAIROBI-HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION-SYSTEM

OBJECTIVE: Build a Predictive Machine Learning System to predict the house prices in different demographic areas within Nairobi Metropolitan area - Kenya. Then build a ChatBot for user engagement with this Housing prices information.


🛠️ Tools, Frameworks, and Technologies:
- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Data Manipulation: Pandas, Numpy
- Visualization: Matplotlib
- Web Frameworks: Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit. Used Flask
- APIs: OpenAI APIs

🔍 Project Overview:
1. Web Scraping: Scrape relevant sites to gather house data.
2. Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess the data.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and visualize the data.
4. Modeling: Build and train the predictive models.
5. Deployment: Deploy the model using a web framework.
6. Chatbot Creation: Develop an RAG chatbot, using OpenAI APIs, for user engagement that provides housing information in Kenya.
